 1. Accept incoming API requests (basically, allows non-peers to query peers).

 2. Choose n nodes randomly to send incoming API requests, for example:
    Authenticate(person ID)
 3. Bootstrap peers. Bootstraps lookout nodes at same time
 4. Validate peerâ€™s NameSystem and correct errors or detect attacks
